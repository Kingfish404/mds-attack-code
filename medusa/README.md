## Building and running a PoC

### Pre-requesits

https://github.com/danielmgmi/medusa

In order to build the proof-of-concept codes, make sure that you have cloned the
PTEditor repository and compiled it:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cd PTEditor
    make

### Building a PoC

In order to build a PoC, change into its directory and run:

    make

## Running a PoC

Building the proof-of-concept yields an executable binary called `leak`.
In order to execute the PoC, run:

    ./leak

or, if you want to bind it to a certain CPU core:

    taskset -c 3 ./leak

The same procedure applies for the victim codes. Just run `make` in the folder
and execute the victim by running:

    taskset -c 7 ./secret
